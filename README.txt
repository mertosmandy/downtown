Downtown is a single-player game implemented in System Verilog for a FPGA board (BASYS-3).
It resembles basketball. The game begins with a ball and the hoop moving automatically to the right and the left.
The player is challenged to shoot and therefore, pass the all levels.
In addition to FPGA board, seven segment digits, buttons, 8x8 Dot-Matrix LED display, and ultrasonic module are used.

Downtown is implemented in System Verilog.
To run the project, Xilinx Design Tools Vivado HL WebPACK 2017.4 is needed.
